In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving technological landscape, cloud-native architectures have become essential for building secure, scalable and distributed applications. In this thesis we explores the implementation of a cloud-native architecture designed to address these key challenges, leveraging advanced tools and techniques to enhance security, scalability, and distributed computation.\cite{1}\\
A significant portion of this research focuses on implementing Role-Based Access Control \abk{RBAC}{Role-Based Access Control} in Kubernetes and automating the entire process. This approach ensures fine-grained access control and enhances the security of the Kubernetes environment\cite{2}. Additionally, the integration of ArgoCD with Keycloak for authentication is examined to enhance security.\\
To achieve scalability, we leverage Ray, a distributed execution framework that enables efficient autoscaling and hyperparameter optimization. Ray's core pillars are implemented to enhance computational efficiency and support distributed computation. This integration ensures that the system can dynamically scale resources based on workload demands, providing a flexible and resilient computing environment.
